    "### Exercise 1: Representing Maze States\n",
    "In a grid-based maze, each cell can be represented by its coordinate and a descriptive label, such as \"wall\", \"food\", or \"path\". You must determine how to represent individual cells and collections of such cells using Python data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Define a coordinate representation for a single cell, create a data record describing the cell, and organize multiple cells into a collection suitable for later search operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- Tuple: An immutable ordered collection used to store coordinates. Tuples cannot be changed after creation, ensuring data stability when used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.\n",
    "- Dictionary: A data mapping structure that associates keys with values. Dictionaries are ideal for storing named properties such as \"position\" and \"type\".\n",
    "- List vs. Dictionary for Collections: A list preserves order and is convenient for iteration, while a dictionary allows constant-time lookup using coordinates as keys."
